# Frogger clone
A simplified clone of the classic game Frogger, written in JavaScript and using HTML5's canvas. This project is part of Udacity's Front-End Nanodegree.

## Playing the Game
You can [play the game](http://davidscales.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game/) directly (easiest) or you can clone the repository, and then open index.html with your browser.

### Game Objective and Controls
The goal is to collect all of the gems on the map, without being attacked by the giant bugs. If the bugs touch you, or you jump into the water, the game will be reset. Use the arrow keys to move your character.
